# Personal Budget Planning

Work in progress

TODO:

- [X] split "Manage entries" into separate Expenses and Income screens
- [X] implement delete entry
- [X] display next 12 months forecast on main screen
- [ ] refresh forecast when getting back from manage expenses/income screen
- [ ] view details for a given month forecast, detailing expenses per category
- [ ] fix forecast calculation to take into account start_date and end_date
- [ ] add special function for "Savings" category: accumulate it on forecast
    => the idea is to be able to forecast:
        - "will i have enough to pay for the upcoming expenses?"
        - "can i afford to spend on something, like a long distance trip?"
- [ ] display an indication (e.g. * in the title) if there are unsaved changes
- [ ] ask confirmation when exiting with unsaved changes
