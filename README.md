# Personal Budget Planning

Work in progress

TODO:

- [X] split "Manage entries" into separate Expenses and Income screens
- [X] implement delete entry
- [ ] display next 6 months forecast on main screen
- [ ] ask confirmation when exiting with unsaved changes
- [ ] add special function for "Savings" category: accumulate it on forecast
    => the idea is to be able to forecast:
        - "will i have enough to pay for the upcoming expenses?"
        - "can i afford to spend on something, like a long distance trip?"
